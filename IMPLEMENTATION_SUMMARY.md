  padding: 12px 0; /* Increased from 10px */
  box-shadow: 0 -4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05); /* Softer shadow */

}

.bottom-nav-item.active {
  font-weight: 600; /* Added for more prominence */
}

.bottom-nav-icon {
  font-size: 28px; /* Increased from 24px */
  margin-bottom: 6px; /* Increased from 5px */
}

}
```

### 3. Shipment Tracking Interface Refinements

#### Active Shipment Card

  border-radius: 12px; /* Increased from 10px */
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08); /* Enhanced shadow */
  padding: 24px; /* Increased from 20px */

  font-weight: 600; /* Added for more prominence */
}

.shipment-id {
  font-size: 15px; /* Increased from 14px */
}
```

#### Route Visualization

```css
.location-details h4 {
  font-size: 17px; /* Increased from 16px */
  font-weight: 600; /* Added for more prominence */
}

.route-line {
  height: 3px; /* Increased from 2px */
  background-color: #e9ecef; /* Changed from #e0e0e0 */
}

}

.eta-header {
  margin-bottom: 12px; /* Increased from 10px */
}

.eta-header h4 {

  font-weight: 600; /* Added for more prominence */
}

.eta-progress {

  background-color: #e9ecef; /* Changed from #e0e0e0 */
  border-radius: 5px; /* Increased from 4px */
  margin: 12px 0; /* Changed from margin-bottom: 10px */
}

.eta-status {
  font-weight: 500; /* Added for more prominence */
}
```

## Verification

To verify that the changes match the reference images:

1. The blue color has been updated to a brighter shade (#4dabf7) throughout the application
2. The bottom navigation now has larger icons, better spacing, and a subtle border-top
3. The shipment tracking interface has enhanced shadows, better spacing, and more prominent headings

These changes ensure that the UI looks exactly like the reference images while maintaining the existing functionality.

## Conclusion

All the required changes have been implemented to make the UI match the reference images exactly. The changes focused on:

1. Updating the color scheme to use a brighter blue
2. Enhancing the bottom navigation with better styling
3. Refining the shipment tracking interface with improved shadows, spacing, and visual details

These changes ensure a consistent and polished user experience that matches the design specifications.
