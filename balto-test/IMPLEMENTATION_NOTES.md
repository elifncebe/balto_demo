# Balto Logistics Platform Implementation Notes

## Changes Made

The following changes have been made to implement the Balto Logistics Platform landing page according to the requirements:

### 1. App.js
- Removed the logo.svg import and image element
- Added text elements for "Balto" and "Shipping that matters"
- Created a clean, centered layout with proper HTML structure

### 2. App.css
- Changed the background color to #1E1D39 (dark purple)
- Removed all logo-related styles and animations
- Added styles for the new text elements:
  - `.balto-text`: Uses Space Grotesk Bold, large font size, proper letter spacing
  - `.tagline-text`: Uses DM Sans Regular, smaller font size, proper spacing
- Ensured all text is centered on the page

### 3. index.html
- Added Google Fonts imports for Space Grotesk Bold and DM Sans Regular
- Updated the page title to "Balto Logistics Platform"

## How to Test

To see the changes in action:

1. Navigate to the balto-test directory:
   ```bash
   cd balto-test
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
