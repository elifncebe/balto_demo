# Static Resource Issue Fix

## Issue Description

The application was encountering errors related to missing static resources:

```
NoResourceFoundException: No static resource index
```

When accessing the root URL (http://localhost:8080/), the application was returning a JSON error message:

```json
{"data":null,"meta":{"timestamp":"2025-08-03T22:57:38.73496","version":"1.0"},"errors":[{"code":"INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR","message":"An error occurred"}]}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the project structure and configuration, the following issues were identified:

1. The HomeController was returning "index" as a view name for the root URL ("/")
2. There was no template engine (like Thymeleaf) configured in the project (missing dependency)
3. Without a template engine, Spring was falling back to looking for a static resource named "index" (not "index.html")
4. Since there was no static resource named exactly "index" (only "index.html"), the request was failing

## Solution Implemented

The solution was to modify the HomeController to redirect to the static index.html file instead of returning "index" as a view name:

```java
@GetMapping("/")
public String home() {
    return "redirect:/index.html";
}
```

This change ensures that:
1. Spring doesn't try to resolve "index" as a view name (which would fail without a template engine)
2. The browser is redirected to "/index.html", which is served as a static resource from the static directory

## Alternative Solutions

Other possible solutions that were considered:

1. **Add Thymeleaf as a dependency**: This would allow Spring to resolve "index" as a view name using Thymeleaf.
   ```gradle
   implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf'
   ```

2. **Serve the index.html file directly**: Modify the HomeController to serve the static index.html file directly.
   ```java
   @GetMapping("/")
   public ModelAndView home() {
       return new ModelAndView("forward:/index.html");
   }
   ```

3. **Add a WebMvcConfigurer**: Configure Spring to handle the root URL by serving the index.html file.
   ```java
   @Configuration
   public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {
       @Override
       public void addViewControllers(ViewControllerRegistry registry) {
           registry.addViewController("/").setViewName("forward:/index.html");
       }
   }
   ```

The redirect approach was chosen for its simplicity and minimal impact on the existing codebase.

## Testing

After implementing this change, the application should be able to serve the frontend correctly without generating the resource-related errors. The frontend should be accessible at:

```
http://localhost:8080/
```

## Future Considerations

For a more robust solution, consider:

1. Adding the Thymeleaf dependency to the project if you plan to use templates
2. Ensuring consistent naming and organization of static resources
3. Adding proper configuration in application.properties for static resources if needed
4. Choosing a consistent approach (either templates or static resources) and organizing files accordingly
