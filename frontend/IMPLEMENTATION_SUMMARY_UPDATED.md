  - ✅ Dashboard screen with load listing
  - ✅ Load details screen
  - ✅ Profile management screen
  - ✅ Messaging screens (list and chat detail)
  - ✅ Notifications screen
- ✅ Implemented core functionality with mock data

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Broker Web App (apps/broker-web)

- ⬜ Set up Next.js application
- ⬜ Create routing structure
- ⬜ Implement authentication screens
- ⬜ Implement dashboard and load management screens
- ⬜ Implement carrier management screens
- ⬜ Implement messaging and notification screens
- ⬜ Design responsive UI

### 2. Broker Mobile App (apps/broker-mobile)

- ⬜ Set up React Native with Expo
- ⬜ Create navigation structure
- ⬜ Implement authentication screens
- ⬜ Implement dashboard and load management screens
- ⬜ Implement carrier management screens
- ⬜ Implement messaging and notification screens
- ⬜ Ensure consistent experience with web app

### 3. Testing Infrastructure

- ⬜ Configure Vitest/Jest for unit testing
- ⬜ Set up Playwright for web e2e testing
- ⬜ Configure Detox for mobile e2e testing
- ⬜ Create test utilities and mocks

### 4. CI/CD and Deployment

- ⬜ Set up GitHub Actions workflows
- ⬜ Configure EAS builds for mobile apps
- ⬜ Set up Vercel deployment for web app
- ⬜ Implement environment-specific configurations

### 5. Realtime and Notification Systems

- ⬜ Implement WebSockets/STOMP for chat and live updates
- ⬜ Set up Expo Push for mobile notifications
- ⬜ Configure Web Push for broker web app
- ⬜ Create notification management system

### 6. Documentation and Guides

- ⬜ Write setup instructions
- ⬜ Create component documentation
- ⬜ Document authentication flow
- ⬜ Provide deployment guides

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Broker Web App**: Focus on implementing the broker web application first, as it will likely be the primary interface for brokers. This should include:
   - Setting up Next.js with TypeScript
   - Creating a responsive layout with the shared UI components
   - Implementing the core screens for load management
   - Integrating with the backend API

2. **Implement Broker Mobile App**: Once the web app is functional, implement the mobile app for brokers, reusing components and logic where possible.

3. **Connect to Real API Endpoints**: Replace mock data with real API calls once the backend is ready.

4. **Set Up Testing Infrastructure**: Develop a testing strategy and implement tests for all applications.

5. **Configure Deployment Pipelines**: Set up CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.

## Technical Debt and Considerations

- **State Management**: Consider implementing a more robust state management solution (Redux, MobX, Zustand) as the applications grow.

- **Form Handling**: Evaluate form libraries like Formik or React Hook Form for more complex forms.

- **API Type Safety**: Consider generating API types from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications.

- **Offline Support**: Evaluate requirements for offline functionality in mobile apps.

- **Accessibility**: Ensure all applications meet accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1).

- **Internationalization**: Plan for multi-language support if required.

## Conclusion

The foundation for the logistics platform frontend has been established with a focus on code sharing and consistency across applications. The customer mobile app is fully implemented, demonstrating the architecture and patterns to be used in the broker applications. The shared packages provide a solid foundation for rapid development of the remaining applications while maintaining design consistency.

The next phase of development should focus on implementing the broker applications, comprehensive testing, and setting up the deployment infrastructure.
