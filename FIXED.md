# Balto Test - Fixed Application

## Problem

The application had several issues that prevented it from running correctly:

1. The `SimpleApp.java` file had duplicate code
2. The `WebSecurityConfig.java` file was incomplete
3. The build.gradle configuration was causing conflicts

## Solution

We've fixed these issues and provided several ways to run the application:

### Option 1: Simple Bypass Mode (No Spring Boot)

```bash
chmod +x SIMPLE_RUN.sh
./SIMPLE_RUN.sh
```

This will run the application in bypass mode without starting Spring Boot, which avoids all configuration issues.

### Option 2: Simple Spring Boot Mode

```bash
./gradlew bootRun -PmainClass=com.baltotest.SimpleApp --args='--spring.profiles.active=simple'
```

This will run a simplified Spring Boot application that doesn't use security or database dependencies.

### Option 3: Full Application

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

This will run the full application with all dependencies.

## Accessing the Application

Once running, the application is available at:

- http://localhost:8080 - Home page
- http://localhost:8080/hello - Hello endpoint
- http://localhost:8080/api/status - API status endpoint
- http://localhost:8080/shutdown - Shutdown the application

## Common Issues

1. **80% EXECUTING message**: This is normal for Spring Boot applications - it means the application is running and waiting for requests.

2. **Java file errors**: If you see errors about Java files, make sure all the files are correctly formatted with proper imports and class definitions.

3. **Port conflicts**: If port 8080 is already in use, change the port using `--server.port=8081`.

4. **Database connection**: If you see database connection errors, run the application with the SimpleApp class which doesn't require a database.
