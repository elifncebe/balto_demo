# Balto Test Solution Guide

This guide provides multiple approaches to fix the application issues.

## Quick Solution

1. Make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

2. Try each of the following solutions in order until one works:

### Option 1: Run the Test App

```bash
./RUN_TEST_APP.sh
```

This runs a minimal test application with no database dependencies.

### Option 2: Run with Minimal Configuration

```bash
./MINIMAL_RUN.sh
```

This creates and runs a simplified application with minimal dependencies.

### Option 3: Run the Main App with Exclusions

```bash
./RUN_MAIN_APP.sh
```

This runs the main application but excludes database dependencies.

### Option 4: Comprehensive Fix

```bash
./FIX_ALL.sh
```

This completely rebuilds all necessary files and runs the application.

## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues, run the debug script to get more information:

```bash
./DEBUG_INFO.sh
```

## Common Issues

1. **Duplicate Code**: The Java files had duplicate content, causing compilation errors.

2. **Security Configuration**: The security configuration was improperly set up.

3. **Database Dependencies**: The application was trying to connect to a non-existent database.

4. **Java Version**: Make sure you're using Java 17 or later.

## Running the Application Manually

If you want to run the application manually:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun -PmainClass=com.baltotest.TestApp --args='--spring.autoconfigure.exclude=org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceAutoConfiguration'
```

Or with the main application:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.autoconfigure.exclude=org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceAutoConfiguration,org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.HibernateJpaAutoConfiguration'
```
